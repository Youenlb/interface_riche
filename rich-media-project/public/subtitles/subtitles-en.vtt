WEBVTT

00:02:57.427 --> 00:03:00.726
They ought to make the day the time changes
the first day of summer.

00:03:00.806 --> 00:03:03.525
- What?
- Well, it's 8 o'clock and it's still light.

00:03:04.142 --> 00:03:06.732
A lot of good the extra daylight does us.

00:03:06.812 --> 00:03:10.611
Now, we've still got a three-hour drive back.
We're not gonna be home until after midnight.

00:03:10.691 --> 00:03:13.319
Well, if it really bugged you, Johnny,
you wouldn't do it.

00:03:13.402 --> 00:03:16.450
You think I wanna blow Sunday
on a scene like this?

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:19.244
You know, I figure we're either gonna
have to move Mother out here,

00:03:19.324 --> 00:03:21.246
or move the grave into Pittsburgh.

00:03:21.326 --> 00:03:25.500
- She can't make a trip like this.
- Oh, I don't know that she can't.

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:28.045
Is there any of that candy left?

00:03:28.125 --> 00:03:29.377
No.

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:31.587
Look at this thing. "We still remember."

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:35.135
I don't. You know, I don't even remember
what the man looks like.

00:03:35.215 --> 00:03:37.179
Johnny, it takes you five minutes.

00:03:37.259 --> 00:03:39.348
Yeah, five minutes
to put the wreath on the grave

00:03:39.428 --> 00:03:41.875
and six hours to drive back and forth.

00:03:41.955 --> 00:03:45.181
Mother wants to remember,
so we trot 200 miles into the country

00:03:45.261 --> 00:03:48.278
- and she stays at home.
- Well, we're here, John. All right?

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:53.734
Testing. Are we back on?

00:03:53.817 --> 00:03:56.365
Oh. Uh, ladies and gentlemen...

00:03:56.445 --> 00:03:57.491
Hey, do...

00:03:57.571 --> 00:04:01.041
we're coming back on the air after
an interruption due to technicalprobl...

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:16.843
There's nothing wrong with the radio.
Must've been the station.

00:04:16.923 --> 00:04:18.675
Which row is it in?

00:04:39.237 --> 00:04:41.159
Boy, there's no one around.

00:04:41.239 --> 00:04:43.954
Well, it's late.
If you'd gotten up earlier...

00:04:44.034 --> 00:04:47.163
Oh, look, I already lost an hour's sleep
on the time change.

00:04:47.245 --> 00:04:50.335
I think you complain
just to hear yourself talk.

00:04:50.415 --> 00:04:52.088
There it is.

00:05:07.724 --> 00:05:10.443
I wonder what happened
to the one from last year.

00:05:11.353 --> 00:05:13.775
Each year we spend good money
on these things.

00:05:13.855 --> 00:05:16.483
We come out here,
and the one from last year is gone.

00:05:16.566 --> 00:05:21.408
Well, the flowers die, and the caretaker
or somebody takes them away.

00:05:21.488 --> 00:05:26.244
Yeah, a little spit and polish,
he can clean this up, sell it next year.

00:05:26.326 --> 00:05:29.249
Wonder how many times
we've bought the same one.

00:05:46.721 --> 00:05:49.770
Hey, come on, Barb.
Church was this morning, huh?

00:06:08.702 --> 00:06:11.374
Hey, I mean, praying's for church, huh?

00:06:11.454 --> 00:06:13.293
Come on.

00:06:13.373 --> 00:06:15.945
I haven't seen you in church lately.

00:06:16.025 --> 00:06:20.006
Well, there's not much sense
in my going to church.

00:06:21.006 --> 00:06:24.721
Do you remember one time
when we were small, we were out here?

00:06:24.801 --> 00:06:26.428
It was from right over there.

00:06:26.511 --> 00:06:28.433
I jumped out at you from behind a tree,

00:06:28.513 --> 00:06:31.436
and Grandpa got all excited,
and he shook his fist at me and he said,

00:06:31.516 --> 00:06:33.605
"Boy, you'll be damned to hell."

00:06:34.185 --> 00:06:36.813
Remember that? Right over there.

00:06:36.897 --> 00:06:39.901
You used to really be scared here.

00:06:39.983 --> 00:06:41.655
Johnny.

00:06:41.735 --> 00:06:43.406
Hey, you're still afraid.

00:06:43.486 --> 00:06:45.489
Stop it now. I mean it.

00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:52.170
They're coming to get you, Barbra.

00:06:52.954 --> 00:06:55.082
Stop it! You're ignorant!

00:06:55.165 --> 00:06:58.088
They're coming for you, Barbra.

00:06:58.168 --> 00:07:00.671
Stop it. You're acting like a child.

00:07:00.754 --> 00:07:02.717
They're coming for you.

00:07:02.797 --> 00:07:05.346
Look! There comes one of them now!

00:07:06.301 --> 00:07:08.515
- He'll hear you.
- Here he comes now.

00:07:08.595 --> 00:07:10.632
- I'm getting out of here.
- Johnny!

00:07:18.749 --> 00:07:20.027
No!

00:07:21.066 --> 00:07:22.693
No! Johnny!

00:07:22.776 --> 00:07:24.870
Help me! Help!

00:14:33.456 --> 00:14:34.799
It's all right.

00:14:38.544 --> 00:14:40.466
Don't worry about him. I can handle him.

00:14:40.546 --> 00:14:43.550
Probably be a lot more of them
as soon as they find out about us.

00:14:46.928 --> 00:14:48.224
Truck is out of gas.

00:14:48.304 --> 00:14:50.272
This pump out here is locked. Is there a key?

00:14:52.225 --> 00:14:55.820
We can try to get out of here
if we can get some gas. Is there a key?

00:15:05.154 --> 00:15:07.157
I suppose you've tried this.

00:15:17.041 --> 00:15:18.793
Do you live here?

00:15:31.514 --> 00:15:33.391
Jesus.

00:15:41.774 --> 00:15:43.696
We've gotta get out of here.

00:15:43.776 --> 00:15:46.154
We have to get to where
there are some other people.

00:15:49.407 --> 00:15:51.996
M-Maybe we better take some food.

00:15:52.076 --> 00:15:54.374
I'll see if I can find some food.

00:16:38.915 --> 00:16:41.794
- What's happening?
- I'll be just a second.

00:16:42.793 --> 00:16:44.011
What's happening?

00:16:57.642 --> 00:16:59.235
Two of them.

00:17:04.315 --> 00:17:07.113
There are two of them out there.
Have you seen any more around here?

00:17:07.193 --> 00:17:09.657
- I can take care of those two.
- I don't know. I don't know.

00:17:09.737 --> 00:17:12.785
- I know you're afraid, but we have to...
- I don't know! I don't know!

00:17:14.065 --> 00:17:15.889
What's happening?

00:19:34.215 --> 00:19:36.058
They know we're in here now.

00:19:51.107 --> 00:19:52.529
Don't look at it.

00:21:05.681 --> 00:21:08.105
Get some more lights on in this house.

00:21:45.638 --> 00:21:48.561
Why don't you see if you can find some wood,
some boards, something there by the fireplace,

00:21:48.641 --> 00:21:50.644
something we can nail this place up.

00:21:55.523 --> 00:21:57.150
Look, goddamn it...

00:21:59.735 --> 00:22:03.200
Look. I know you're afraid.

00:22:03.280 --> 00:22:05.369
I'm afraid too.

00:22:05.449 --> 00:22:08.077
But we have to try to
board the house up together.

00:22:08.160 --> 00:22:11.375
Now, I'm going to board up the windows
and the doors. Do you understand?

00:22:11.455 --> 00:22:13.002
We'll be all right here.

00:22:13.082 --> 00:22:15.710
We'll be all right here
till someone comes to rescue us.

00:22:15.793 --> 00:22:17.715
But we have to work together.
You'll have to help me.

00:22:17.795 --> 00:22:20.718
Now, go in and get some wood
so I can board the place up.

00:22:20.798 --> 00:22:23.096
Do you understand? Okay?

00:22:23.843 --> 00:22:25.345
Okay?

00:25:03.836 --> 00:25:06.550
That'll hold 'em.
Those things aren't that strong.

00:25:06.630 --> 00:25:10.100
Here, I want you to pick out some nails.
Pick out the biggest ones you can find.

00:25:15.264 --> 00:25:17.267
There. This room looks pretty secure.

00:25:20.227 --> 00:25:23.231
If we have to, we can run in here
and board up the doors.

00:25:25.941 --> 00:25:30.447
Won't be long before those things'll be back,
pounding their way in here. They're afraid now.

00:25:34.533 --> 00:25:36.911
They're afraid of fire. I found that out.

00:25:49.006 --> 00:25:52.306
You know a place back down the road
called Beekman's? Beekman's Diner?

00:25:59.933 --> 00:26:03.062
Anyhow, that's where I found that truck
I have out there.

00:26:05.147 --> 00:26:07.150
There's a radio in the truck.

00:26:08.275 --> 00:26:10.403
I had jumped in to listen to it...

00:26:11.195 --> 00:26:14.618
when a big gasoline truck
came screaming right across the road.

00:26:14.698 --> 00:26:19.079
Well, there must have been
10, 15 of those things chasing after it,

00:26:20.329 --> 00:26:22.047
grabbing and holding on.

00:26:25.334 --> 00:26:27.337
I didn't see them at first.

00:26:28.921 --> 00:26:32.346
I could just see that the truck
was moving in a funny way.

00:26:33.133 --> 00:26:35.136
And those things were catching up to it.

00:26:38.055 --> 00:26:40.774
Truck went right across the road.

00:26:42.184 --> 00:26:45.524
Slammed on my brakes
to keep from hitting it myself.

00:26:45.604 --> 00:26:47.607
It went right through the guardrail.

00:26:52.486 --> 00:26:54.408
I guess...

00:26:54.488 --> 00:26:57.992
I guess the driver
must have cut off the road,

00:26:58.075 --> 00:27:00.123
into that gas station by Beekman's Diner.

00:27:01.787 --> 00:27:03.539
It went right through the billboard,

00:27:03.622 --> 00:27:06.462
ripped over a gas pump
and never stopped moving.

00:27:06.542 --> 00:27:09.170
By now it was like a moving bonfire.

00:27:12.589 --> 00:27:15.593
Didn't know if the truck
was going to explode or what.

00:27:18.345 --> 00:27:21.815
I can still hear the man screaming...

00:27:26.395 --> 00:27:29.399
these things just backing away from it.

00:27:32.484 --> 00:27:37.365
I looked back at the diner to see if there
was anyone there who could help me.

00:27:39.783 --> 00:27:41.786
That was when I noticed that...

00:27:42.703 --> 00:27:45.047
the entire place had been encircled.

00:27:46.915 --> 00:27:49.634
Wasn't a sign of life left, except...

00:27:53.755 --> 00:27:55.758
By now, there were no more screams.

00:27:58.051 --> 00:27:59.473
I realized that...

00:28:01.221 --> 00:28:02.643
I was alone,

00:28:02.723 --> 00:28:05.477
with 50 or 60 of those things

00:28:05.559 --> 00:28:10.565
just standing there, staring at me.

00:28:12.691 --> 00:28:14.989
I-I started to drive. I...

00:28:16.195 --> 00:28:18.323
just plowed right through them.

00:28:19.489 --> 00:28:21.708
They didn't move. They didn't run or...

00:28:23.535 --> 00:28:25.708
Just stood there, staring at me.

00:28:28.457 --> 00:28:30.710
I just wanted to crush them.

00:28:32.961 --> 00:28:34.463
They...

00:28:36.256 --> 00:28:39.180
scattered through the air, like bugs.

00:28:42.054 --> 00:28:44.478
We were riding in the cemetery...

00:28:45.182 --> 00:28:46.775
Johnny and me.

00:28:47.893 --> 00:28:49.236
Johnny.

00:28:53.690 --> 00:28:55.529
We...

00:28:55.609 --> 00:28:59.660
We came to put a wreath on my father's grave,

00:29:01.782 --> 00:29:03.580
Johnny and m...

00:29:04.243 --> 00:29:05.745
And he said,

00:29:06.828 --> 00:29:09.877
"Can I have some candy, Barbra?"

00:29:12.918 --> 00:29:15.012
And we didn't have any.

00:29:17.923 --> 00:29:19.550
And...

00:29:22.052 --> 00:29:24.555
Oh, it's hot in here.

00:29:25.597 --> 00:29:27.099
Hot.

00:29:32.396 --> 00:29:34.610
Uh, and he said,

00:29:34.690 --> 00:29:36.653
"Oh, it's late.

00:29:36.733 --> 00:29:39.531
Why did we start so late?"

00:29:39.611 --> 00:29:40.949
And I said,

00:29:41.029 --> 00:29:46.377
"Johnny, if you'd gotten up earlier,
we wouldn't be late."

00:29:47.619 --> 00:29:50.834
Johnny asked me if I were afraid.

00:29:50.914 --> 00:29:53.963
And I said, "I'm not afraid, Johnny."

00:29:55.836 --> 00:29:59.181
And then this man
started walking up the road.

00:30:00.924 --> 00:30:03.138
He came slowly,

00:30:03.218 --> 00:30:05.557
and Johnny kept teasing me and saying,

00:30:05.637 --> 00:30:08.106
"He's coming to get you, Barbra."

00:30:08.807 --> 00:30:12.027
And I laughed at him and said,
"Johnny, stop it."

00:30:13.145 --> 00:30:15.773
And then Johnny ran away.

00:30:15.856 --> 00:30:17.233
And I...

00:30:17.316 --> 00:30:21.697
I went up to this man,
and I was going to apologize.

00:30:22.321 --> 00:30:24.493
Why don't you just keep calm?

00:30:24.573 --> 00:30:26.411
And I looked up, and...

00:30:26.491 --> 00:30:28.084
and I said, "Good eve..."

00:30:29.453 --> 00:30:31.126
And he grabbed me.

00:30:32.080 --> 00:30:34.169
He grabbed me!

00:30:34.249 --> 00:30:36.588
And he ripped at me!

00:30:36.668 --> 00:30:39.547
He held me and he ripped at my clothes!

00:30:39.629 --> 00:30:42.177
I think you should just calm down.

00:30:42.257 --> 00:30:44.930
Oh, I screamed, "Johnny!

00:30:45.010 --> 00:30:46.637
Johnny, help me!

00:30:46.720 --> 00:30:48.848
Oh, help me!"

00:30:48.930 --> 00:30:50.852
And he wouldn't let me go.

00:30:50.932 --> 00:30:52.435
He ripped...

00:30:53.977 --> 00:30:59.069
And then Johnny came, and he ran,
and he... he fought this man.

00:30:59.149 --> 00:31:02.904
And I got so afraid, I ran.

00:31:02.986 --> 00:31:04.283
I ran.

00:31:05.072 --> 00:31:06.494
I ran.

00:31:08.867 --> 00:31:10.915
And Johnny didn't come.

00:31:12.287 --> 00:31:15.712
We've got... We have to wait for Johnny.

00:31:21.338 --> 00:31:24.057
Maybe we'd better go out and get him.

00:31:25.675 --> 00:31:27.764
We have to go out and get Johnny.

00:31:27.844 --> 00:31:29.346
He's out there.

00:31:30.639 --> 00:31:32.102
Please! Don't you hear me?

00:31:32.182 --> 00:31:34.355
We've got to go out and get him.

00:31:36.103 --> 00:31:37.316
Please!

00:31:37.396 --> 00:31:39.985
We have got to go get Johnny!

00:31:40.065 --> 00:31:42.068
Please help me!

00:31:42.150 --> 00:31:43.864
Please!

00:31:43.944 --> 00:31:46.908
Don't you know what's going on out there?
This is no Sunday school picnic.

00:31:46.988 --> 00:31:49.953
Don't you understand? My brother is alone!

00:31:50.033 --> 00:31:52.286
- Your brother is dead.
- No!

00:31:52.369 --> 00:31:54.463
My brother is not dead!

00:31:55.288 --> 00:31:56.692
No!

00:32:47.757 --> 00:32:50.761
Because of the obvious threat
to untold numbers of citizens,

00:32:50.844 --> 00:32:53.598
and because of the crisis
which is even now developing,

00:32:53.680 --> 00:32:57.059
this radio station will remain
on the air, day and night.

00:32:57.142 --> 00:32:59.856
This station and hundreds
of other radio and TV stations

00:32:59.936 --> 00:33:01.483
throughout this part of the country

00:33:01.563 --> 00:33:04.528
are pooling their resources
through an emergency network hookup

00:33:04.608 --> 00:33:06.986
to keep you informed of all developments.

00:33:07.068 --> 00:33:09.908
At this hour, we repeat,
these are the facts as we know them.

00:33:09.988 --> 00:33:12.452
There is an epidemic of mass murder
being committed

00:33:12.532 --> 00:33:15.455
by a virtual army of unidentified assassins.

00:33:15.535 --> 00:33:19.709
The murders are taking place
in villages, cities, rural homes, and suburbs

00:33:19.789 --> 00:33:22.754
with no apparent pattern
or reason for the slayings.

00:33:22.834 --> 00:33:26.464
It seems to be a sudden,
general explosion of mass homicide.

00:33:26.546 --> 00:33:29.094
We have some descriptions of the assassins.

00:33:29.174 --> 00:33:31.888
Eyewitnesses say
they are ordinary-looking people.

00:33:31.968 --> 00:33:34.471
Some say they appear to be
in a kind of trance.

00:33:34.554 --> 00:33:35.931
Others describe them as being...

00:33:45.982 --> 00:33:48.986
So, at this point there is no
really authentic way for us to say

00:33:49.069 --> 00:33:52.159
who or what to look for
and guard yourself against...

00:33:52.239 --> 00:33:54.492
misshapen monsters.

00:33:54.574 --> 00:33:58.290
Reaction of law enforcement officials
is one of complete bewilderment at this hour.

00:33:58.370 --> 00:34:00.959
So far we have been unable to determine

00:34:01.039 --> 00:34:04.212
that any kind of
organized investigation is yet under way.

00:34:04.292 --> 00:34:07.132
Police, sheriffs' deputies
and emergency ambulances

00:34:07.212 --> 00:34:09.634
are literally deluged with calls for help.

00:34:09.714 --> 00:34:12.053
The scene can best be described as mayhem.

00:34:12.133 --> 00:34:14.806
Mayors of Pittsburgh,
Philadelphia, and Miami,

00:34:14.886 --> 00:34:17.851
along with the governors of several
Eastern and Midwestern states,

00:34:17.931 --> 00:34:21.104
have indicated the national guard
may be mobilized at any moment,

00:34:21.184 --> 00:34:23.061
but that has not happened as yet.

00:34:23.144 --> 00:34:27.110
The only advice our reporters
have been able to get from official sources

00:34:27.190 --> 00:34:31.445
is for private citizens to stay
in their homes behind locked doors.

00:34:31.528 --> 00:34:33.656
Do not venture outside for any reason

00:34:33.738 --> 00:34:36.036
until the nature of this crisis
has been determined

00:34:36.116 --> 00:34:38.870
and until we can advise
what course of action to take.

00:34:38.952 --> 00:34:41.249
Keep listening to radio and TV

00:34:41.329 --> 00:34:45.253
for any special instructions
as this crisis develops further.

00:34:45.333 --> 00:34:47.756
Thousands of office and factory workers

00:34:47.836 --> 00:34:50.383
are being urged
to stay at their places of employment,

00:34:50.463 --> 00:34:52.966
not to make any attempt
to get to their homes.

00:34:53.049 --> 00:34:55.138
However, in spite of this urging and warning,

00:34:55.218 --> 00:34:59.223
streets and highways are packed with
frantic people trying to reach their families,

00:34:59.306 --> 00:35:01.895
or apparently to flee just anywhere.

00:35:01.975 --> 00:35:06.401
We repeat: The safest course of action
at this time is simply to stay where you...

00:35:25.874 --> 00:35:27.796
Ladies and gentlemen,
we've just received word

00:35:27.876 --> 00:35:30.504
that the president
has called a meeting of his cabinet

00:35:30.587 --> 00:35:32.551
to deal with the sudden epidemic of murder

00:35:32.631 --> 00:35:35.053
which has seized
the eastern third of this nation.

00:35:35.133 --> 00:35:37.472
The meeting is scheduled
to convene within the hour.

00:35:37.552 --> 00:35:39.474
Members of the presidential cabinet

00:35:39.554 --> 00:35:44.396
will be joined by officials of the FBI
and the joint chiefs behind closed doors.

00:35:44.476 --> 00:35:46.979
A White House spokesman,
in announcing this conference,

00:35:47.062 --> 00:35:50.777
says there will be an official announcement
as soon as possible following that meeting.

00:35:50.857 --> 00:35:53.697
This is the latest dispatch
just received in our newsroom.

00:35:53.777 --> 00:35:58.908
Latest word also from national press services
in Washington, DC, now tells us

00:35:58.990 --> 00:36:01.705
that the emergency presidential conference
which we've just mentioned

00:36:01.785 --> 00:36:03.707
will include high-ranking scientists

00:36:03.787 --> 00:36:06.751
from the National Aeronautics
and Space Administration.

00:36:06.831 --> 00:36:08.895
That's the extent of this latest...

00:36:18.051 --> 00:36:21.305
All radio and TV stations
across the eastern part of the country,

00:36:21.388 --> 00:36:23.391
including the one to which you are listening,

00:36:23.473 --> 00:36:25.812
have joined their facilities
in an emergency network

00:36:25.892 --> 00:36:28.020
to bring you this news as it develops.

00:36:28.103 --> 00:36:34.404
We urge you to stay tuned to radio and TV
and to stay indoors at all costs.

00:36:34.484 --> 00:36:37.363
Late reports reaching this newsroom
tell of frightened people

00:36:37.445 --> 00:36:40.410
seeking refuge in churches, schools,
and government buildings,

00:36:40.490 --> 00:36:43.288
demanding shelter and protection
from the wholesale murder

00:36:43.368 --> 00:36:45.332
which apparently is engulfing
much of the nation.

00:36:45.412 --> 00:36:49.836
Law enforcement officials are at a loss
to explain or, even at this hour,

00:36:49.916 --> 00:36:53.214
even to theorize about the reasons
for this wave of murder.

00:36:53.294 --> 00:36:56.924
So far, all they're able to give the public
is something similar to the response

00:36:57.006 --> 00:37:00.135
of Chief T.K. Dunmore
of Camden, North Carolina,

00:37:00.218 --> 00:37:02.140
who is quoted as saying, quote,

00:37:02.220 --> 00:37:05.018
"Tell the people, for God's sake,
to get off the streets.

00:37:05.098 --> 00:37:08.352
Tell 'em to go home
and lock their doors and windows up tight.

00:37:08.435 --> 00:37:12.025
We don't know what kind of
murder-happy characters we have here."

00:37:12.105 --> 00:37:15.735
End quote. That's Chief Dunmore
of Camden, North Carolina.

00:37:16.651 --> 00:37:20.906
So far the only descriptions,
the only clues anyone has of the killers

00:37:20.989 --> 00:37:23.161
come from frightened witnesses.

00:37:23.241 --> 00:37:27.916
These eyewitness accounts variously describe
the murderers as "ordinary looking people, "

00:37:27.996 --> 00:37:31.586
"misshapen monsters,"
"people who look like they're in a trance, "

00:37:31.666 --> 00:37:35.546
and "things that look like people
but act like animals."

00:37:35.628 --> 00:37:37.676
Some eyewitnesses tell of seeing victims

00:37:37.756 --> 00:37:40.929
who look as though they had been torn apart.

00:37:41.009 --> 00:37:44.307
This whole ghastly story
began developing two days ago

00:37:44.387 --> 00:37:46.559
with the report of the slaying
of a family of seven

00:37:46.639 --> 00:37:48.978
in their rural home near Gulfport, Louisiana.

00:37:49.058 --> 00:37:52.482
Since then, reports of some
senseless killings began snowballing

00:37:52.562 --> 00:37:56.486
in a reign of terror which has hopscotched
in an erratic and disconnected pattern

00:37:56.566 --> 00:37:59.570
throughout much of the eastern
and midwestern United States.

00:37:59.652 --> 00:38:03.702
Efforts to keep track of the murder reports
by the placing of markers on a map

00:38:03.782 --> 00:38:07.787
seem to indicate a general spreading
from the extreme southeastern United States

00:38:07.869 --> 00:38:09.371
to the north and west.

00:38:09.454 --> 00:38:12.877
Our newsmen have been on the telephone,
talking with officials in other cities,

00:38:12.957 --> 00:38:16.336
and have determined
that none of this kind of mass murder

00:38:16.419 --> 00:38:18.883
has yet been reported
west of the Mississippi River,

00:38:18.963 --> 00:38:23.344
except in the extreme
southeastern portion of Texas.

00:38:23.426 --> 00:38:26.641
Similar killings have been reported
around the Houston and Galveston areas,

00:38:26.721 --> 00:38:29.725
- but nothing like the...
- I found a gun and some bullets out there.

00:38:30.683 --> 00:38:32.605
- It was only late yesterday...
- Oh, and these.

00:38:32.685 --> 00:38:36.651
That it soon became clear that we were
facing some kind of national emergency.

00:38:36.731 --> 00:38:39.028
When first reports began filtering in,

00:38:39.108 --> 00:38:41.281
newsmen and law enforcement agencies
were of the opinion...

00:38:41.361 --> 00:38:43.785
This place is boarded up pretty solid now.

00:38:44.948 --> 00:38:47.787
We ought to be all right here for a while.

00:38:47.867 --> 00:38:51.708
We have the gun and the bullets,
food and the radio.

00:38:51.788 --> 00:38:54.711
...began to suspect
an obscure kind of conspiracy.

00:38:54.791 --> 00:38:57.714
Sooner or later,
someone's bound to come and get us out.

00:38:57.794 --> 00:38:59.466
...creatures from outer space.

00:38:59.546 --> 00:39:04.677
Again, we join with law enforcement agencies
in urging you to seek shelter in a building.

00:39:04.759 --> 00:39:06.681
Lock the doors and windows securely.

00:39:06.761 --> 00:39:08.683
Hey, that's us. We're doing all right.

00:39:08.763 --> 00:39:11.016
Be cautious of any suspicious strangers,

00:39:11.099 --> 00:39:13.727
and keep tuned to your radio and television
for survival instructions

00:39:13.810 --> 00:39:16.188
and further details of this continuing story.

00:39:16.271 --> 00:39:18.294
Look, I don't know if you're hearing me...

00:39:19.074 --> 00:39:20.651
but I'm going upstairs now.

00:39:20.733 --> 00:39:22.986
It's almost as though
some critical balance...

00:39:23.069 --> 00:39:25.366
If anything should try to break in here,
I can hear it from up there.

00:39:25.446 --> 00:39:27.949
I'll be down to take care of it.

00:39:28.032 --> 00:39:29.534
We repeat: This radio station...

00:39:29.617 --> 00:39:34.083
Everything is all right for now. I'll be back
to reinforce the windows and doors later.

00:39:34.163 --> 00:39:36.507
But you'll be all right for now. Okay?

00:39:39.002 --> 00:39:40.720
Okay?

00:39:43.673 --> 00:39:46.387
Civil defense officials in Cumberland
have told newsmen

00:39:46.467 --> 00:39:49.390
that murder victims
show evidence of having been

00:39:49.470 --> 00:39:52.064
partially devoured by their murderers.

00:40:30.929 --> 00:40:33.142
Consistent reports from witnesses
to the effect

00:40:33.222 --> 00:40:35.937
that people who acted as though
they were in a kind of trance

00:40:36.017 --> 00:40:38.356
were killing and eating their victims

00:40:38.436 --> 00:40:41.484
prompted authorities to examine
the bodies of some of the victims.

00:40:41.564 --> 00:40:45.444
Medical authorities in Cumberland
have concluded that in all cases

00:40:45.526 --> 00:40:50.076
the killers are eating the flesh
of the people they murder.

00:40:50.156 --> 00:40:54.247
Repeating this latest bulletin just received
moments ago from Cumberland, Maryland,

00:40:54.327 --> 00:40:58.001
civil defense authorities have told newsmen
that murder victims show evidence

00:40:58.081 --> 00:41:01.671
of having been partially devoured
by their murderers.

00:41:01.751 --> 00:41:04.591
Medical examination of victims' bodies
shows conclusively

00:41:04.671 --> 00:41:08.050
that the killers are eating the flesh
of the people they kill.

00:41:09.300 --> 00:41:13.224
And so this incredible story
becomes more ghastly with each report.

00:41:13.304 --> 00:41:16.686
It's difficult to imagine
such a thing actually happening,

00:41:16.766 --> 00:41:19.606
but these are the reports we have been
receiving and passing on to you,

00:41:19.686 --> 00:41:24.192
reports which have been verified as completely
as is possible in this confused situation.

00:41:24.273 --> 00:41:27.277
It is happening, and it would appear
that no one is safe

00:41:27.360 --> 00:41:28.823
from this wave of mass...

00:41:28.903 --> 00:41:31.367
Hey! Come here!

00:41:31.447 --> 00:41:33.666
Calm... Calm down! Calm down!

00:41:37.877 --> 00:41:40.460
Hold it! Don't shoot. We're from town.

00:41:40.540 --> 00:41:42.462
- A radio!
- ...Butler County, Pennsylvania.

00:41:42.542 --> 00:41:46.422
The Butler County sheriff has verified
that reports of murder victims

00:41:46.504 --> 00:41:49.633
being partially eaten
by their slayers is true.

00:41:49.716 --> 00:41:52.138
No further details available at this time.
However...

00:41:52.218 --> 00:41:55.016
How long you guys been down there?
I could've used some help up here.

00:41:55.096 --> 00:41:56.643
That's the cellar. It's the safest place.

00:41:56.723 --> 00:41:59.395
You mean you didn't hear the racket
we were making up here?

00:41:59.475 --> 00:42:01.603
How were we supposed to know
what was going on?

00:42:01.686 --> 00:42:04.859
- Could've been those things, for all we knew.
- That girl was screaming.

00:42:04.939 --> 00:42:07.028
Surely you must know
what a girl screaming sounds like.

00:42:07.108 --> 00:42:08.360
Those things don't make any noise.

00:42:08.443 --> 00:42:10.657
Anybody would know
somebody's in need of help.

00:42:10.737 --> 00:42:13.365
Look, it's kind of hard to hear
what's going on from down there.

00:42:13.448 --> 00:42:15.370
We thought we could hear screams,

00:42:15.450 --> 00:42:18.373
but for all we knew that could have meant
those things were in the house after her.

00:42:18.453 --> 00:42:21.582
- And you wouldn't come up and help?
- Well, if there were more...

00:42:21.664 --> 00:42:23.711
The racket sounded like
the place was being ripped apart.

00:42:23.791 --> 00:42:25.755
How were we supposed to know
what was going on?

00:42:25.835 --> 00:42:29.590
Now, wait a minute. You just got finished
saying you couldn't hear from down there.

00:42:29.672 --> 00:42:32.011
Now you say it sounded like
this place was being ripped apart.

00:42:32.091 --> 00:42:34.219
It would be nice
if you'd get your story straight, man.

00:42:34.302 --> 00:42:36.975
All right, now you tell me.

00:42:37.055 --> 00:42:40.979
I'm not gonna take that kind of a chance
when we've got a safe place.

00:42:41.059 --> 00:42:44.313
We luck into a safe place, and you're
telling us we've gotta risk our lives

00:42:44.395 --> 00:42:46.818
just because somebody might need help, huh?

00:42:46.898 --> 00:42:48.150
Yeah. Something like that.

00:42:48.232 --> 00:42:50.860
- All right, why don't we settle this...
- Look, mister!

00:42:50.943 --> 00:42:53.157
We came up, okay? We're here.

00:42:53.237 --> 00:42:56.911
I suggest we all go back downstairs before
any of those things find out we're in here.

00:42:56.991 --> 00:42:58.994
They can't get in here.

00:42:59.077 --> 00:43:01.705
- You got the whole place boarded up?
- Yeah, most of it.

00:43:01.788 --> 00:43:04.585
All but a few spots upstairs.
They won't be hard to fix.

00:43:04.665 --> 00:43:07.463
You're insane. The cellar's the safest place.

00:43:07.543 --> 00:43:09.590
I'm telling you, they can't get in here.

00:43:09.670 --> 00:43:12.719
And I'm telling you,
those things turned over our car.

00:43:12.799 --> 00:43:14.512
We were damned lucky to get away at all.

00:43:14.592 --> 00:43:18.933
Now you tell me those things
can't get through this lousy pile of wood?

00:43:19.013 --> 00:43:21.310
His wife and kid's downstairs.

00:43:21.390 --> 00:43:22.892
The kid's hurt.

00:43:24.227 --> 00:43:26.730
Well, I still think we're better off up here.

00:43:27.730 --> 00:43:29.983
We could strengthen everything up,
Mr. Cooper.

00:43:30.066 --> 00:43:32.238
With all of us working,
we could fix this place up in no time.

00:43:32.318 --> 00:43:34.240
We have everything we need up here.

00:43:34.320 --> 00:43:36.948
We can take all that stuff
downstairs with us.

00:43:37.031 --> 00:43:38.745
Man, you're really crazy. You know that?

00:43:38.825 --> 00:43:41.122
You got a million windows up here.
All these windows.

00:43:41.202 --> 00:43:44.000
You're gonna make them strong enough
to keep these things out, huh?

00:43:44.080 --> 00:43:46.044
I told you, those things
don't have any strength.

00:43:46.124 --> 00:43:48.627
I smashed three of them
and pushed another one out the door.

00:43:48.709 --> 00:43:52.133
Did you hear me when I told you
they turned over our car?

00:43:52.213 --> 00:43:55.303
- Oh, hell, any good five men can do that.
- That's my point.

00:43:55.383 --> 00:43:57.597
Only there's not going to be five,
or even 10.

00:43:57.677 --> 00:44:00.099
There's gonna be 20, 30,
maybe a hundred of those things.

00:44:00.179 --> 00:44:02.894
And as soon as they know we're here,
this place is gonna be crawling with them.

00:44:02.974 --> 00:44:06.397
Well, if there are that many,
they'll probably get us wherever we are.

00:44:07.077 --> 00:44:09.481
Look, the cellar.

00:44:09.564 --> 00:44:14.070
The cellar, there's only one door, right?
Just one door. That's all we have to protect.

00:44:14.152 --> 00:44:17.366
Tom and I fixed it
so it locks and boards from the inside.

00:44:17.446 --> 00:44:21.245
But up here, all these windows, why, we'd never
know where they were gonna hit us next.

00:44:21.325 --> 00:44:23.289
You got a point, Mr. Cooper.

00:44:23.369 --> 00:44:25.747
But down in the cellar,
there's no place to run to.

00:44:25.830 --> 00:44:29.460
I mean, if they did get in, there'd be
no back exit. We'd be done for.

00:44:29.542 --> 00:44:30.919
Ah!

00:44:31.002 --> 00:44:32.924
We can get out of here if we have to.

00:44:33.004 --> 00:44:35.883
And we got windows
to see what's going on outside.

00:44:35.965 --> 00:44:39.764
But down there, with no windows, if a rescue
party did come, we wouldn't even know it.

00:44:39.844 --> 00:44:42.058
But the cellar is the strongest place.

00:44:42.138 --> 00:44:43.765
The cellar is a death trap.

00:44:43.848 --> 00:44:46.270
I don't know, Mr. Cooper.

00:44:46.350 --> 00:44:48.189
I think he's right.

00:44:48.269 --> 00:44:50.066
You know how many's out there?

00:44:50.146 --> 00:44:52.068
I don't know. I figure maybe six or seven.

00:44:52.148 --> 00:44:55.613
Look. You two can do whatever you like.

00:44:55.693 --> 00:44:57.740
I'm going back down to the cellar

00:44:57.820 --> 00:45:00.993
and you better decide,
'cause I'm gonna board up that door,

00:45:01.073 --> 00:45:03.746
and I'm not gonna unlock it again,
no matter what happens.

00:45:03.826 --> 00:45:06.079
- Now, wait a minute, Mr. Cooper.
- No, I'm not gonna wait!

00:45:06.162 --> 00:45:08.290
I've made my decision. Now you make yours.

00:45:08.372 --> 00:45:10.962
Now, wait a minute! Let's think about this.

00:45:11.042 --> 00:45:13.840
We can make it to the cellar if we have to.

00:45:13.920 --> 00:45:17.049
And if we do decide to stay down there,
we'll need some things from up here.

00:45:17.131 --> 00:45:20.096
So let's at least consider this a while.

00:45:20.176 --> 00:45:21.973
...at all costs.

00:45:22.053 --> 00:45:23.975
Late reports reaching this newsroom...

00:45:24.055 --> 00:45:27.395
If you box yourself in the cellar and
those things get in the house, you've had it.

00:45:27.475 --> 00:45:29.523
At least up here you have a fighting chance.

00:45:33.856 --> 00:45:36.529
Yeah, it looks like
about eight or 10 out there now.

00:45:36.609 --> 00:45:38.612
That's more than there were.

00:45:38.694 --> 00:45:40.783
There are a lot out back too.

00:45:40.863 --> 00:45:42.866
So far, the best advice they're...

00:46:22.196 --> 00:46:24.118
- Harry?
- It's all right.

00:46:24.198 --> 00:46:26.451
- Harry, what's happening?
- It's... It's all right!

00:46:41.757 --> 00:46:43.179
Damn thing.

00:47:22.590 --> 00:47:24.843
We gotta fix these boards.

00:47:24.925 --> 00:47:26.552
You're crazy!

00:47:26.635 --> 00:47:28.975
Those things are gonna be
at every window and door in this place!

00:47:29.055 --> 00:47:30.768
We've got to get down into the cellar.

00:47:30.848 --> 00:47:33.646
Go down in your damn cellar! Get out of here!

00:47:35.770 --> 00:47:38.023
- I'm... I'm taking the girl with me.
- You leave her here.

00:47:38.105 --> 00:47:41.153
Keep your hands off her,
and everything else that's up here too.

00:47:41.233 --> 00:47:43.823
Because if I stay up here,
I'm fighting for everything up here,

00:47:43.903 --> 00:47:46.575
and the radio and the food
is part of what I'm fighting for.

00:47:46.655 --> 00:47:49.500
- If you're going down in the cellar, get.
- The man's insane.

00:47:50.117 --> 00:47:51.664
He's insane.

00:47:51.744 --> 00:47:53.958
We've got to have food down there.
We've got a right.

00:47:54.038 --> 00:47:56.252
- This your house?
- We've got a right.

00:47:56.332 --> 00:47:58.796
- You going down there with him?
- W-Well, I...

00:47:58.876 --> 00:48:01.800
Yes or no? This is your last chance.
No beating around the bush.

00:48:03.047 --> 00:48:05.136
Listen, I got a kid down there.

00:48:05.216 --> 00:48:07.138
She can't possib...
I couldn't bring her up here.

00:48:07.218 --> 00:48:10.933
She can't possibly take all the racket from
those things smashing through the windows.

00:48:11.013 --> 00:48:12.810
Well, you're her father.

00:48:12.890 --> 00:48:15.518
If you're stupid enough to go die
in that trap, that's your business.

00:48:15.601 --> 00:48:18.691
However, I am not stupid enough
to follow you.

00:48:18.771 --> 00:48:22.025
It is tough for the kid
that her old man is so stupid.

00:48:22.108 --> 00:48:24.611
Now, get the hell down in the cellar.

00:48:24.693 --> 00:48:27.538
You can be the boss down there.
I'm boss up here.

00:48:29.281 --> 00:48:30.828
You bastards!

00:48:33.327 --> 00:48:35.955
You know, I won't open this door again.
I mean it.

00:48:36.038 --> 00:48:38.878
- Mr. Cooper, with your help, we can...
- With my help!

00:48:38.958 --> 00:48:42.337
Let him go, man.
His mind is made up. Just let him go.

00:48:44.797 --> 00:48:46.219
Wait a minute.

00:48:47.758 --> 00:48:49.556
Judy? Come on up here, honey.

00:48:57.101 --> 00:49:00.446
- You're gonna let them get her too, huh?
- It's all right, honey. Go ahead.

00:49:11.407 --> 00:49:14.747
If we stick together, man,
we can fix it up real good.

00:49:14.827 --> 00:49:18.081
But there... there's lots of places
we can run to up here.

00:49:18.164 --> 00:49:19.791
Mr. Cooper?

00:49:19.874 --> 00:49:24.095
We'd all be a lot better off
if all three of us were working together.

00:49:25.254 --> 00:49:26.967
Hey.

00:49:27.047 --> 00:49:28.549
Hey, kid.

00:49:36.807 --> 00:49:38.854
He's wrong, you know.

00:49:38.934 --> 00:49:41.273
I'm not boxing myself in down there.

00:49:41.353 --> 00:49:44.948
To repeat, this radio station
will remain on the air day and night.

00:49:47.902 --> 00:49:51.907
Well, we're safe now. It's boarded up tight.

00:49:51.989 --> 00:49:53.828
What about Tom and Judy?

00:49:53.908 --> 00:49:56.002
They wanna stay up there, let 'em.

00:49:59.872 --> 00:50:03.342
There are... two other people upstairs.

00:50:03.918 --> 00:50:06.882
- A man and a girl.
- We heard the screaming.

00:50:06.962 --> 00:50:08.634
Yeah, but I didn't know who they were,

00:50:08.714 --> 00:50:11.762
and I wasn't about to take
any unnecessary chances.

00:50:11.842 --> 00:50:13.845
Of course not, Harry.

00:50:27.191 --> 00:50:29.613
- Is she all right?
- I don't know what it is.

00:50:29.693 --> 00:50:32.321
She feels warm. Maybe it's shock.

00:50:33.322 --> 00:50:35.325
Where'd you get the bandage?

00:50:35.407 --> 00:50:38.707
Some laundry in a basket. I tore a sheet.

00:50:46.085 --> 00:50:48.258
Let them stay upstairs.

00:50:49.421 --> 00:50:51.549
Let them.

00:50:51.632 --> 00:50:54.511
Too many ways those monsters
can get in up there.

00:50:55.803 --> 00:50:57.850
We'll see who's right.

00:50:57.930 --> 00:51:01.150
We'll see, when they come begging me
to let them in down here.

00:51:01.767 --> 00:51:03.939
- That's important, isn't it?
- What?

00:51:04.019 --> 00:51:07.523
- To be right. Everybody else to be wrong.
- What do you mean by that?

00:51:11.151 --> 00:51:14.154
Does anyone up there know
why we're being attacked?

00:51:15.447 --> 00:51:17.825
Whatever it is, it isn't just happening here.

00:51:17.908 --> 00:51:21.162
It's some kind of mass murder.
It's going on everywhere.

00:51:21.245 --> 00:51:23.248
- The radio said to stay inside...
- Radio?

00:51:24.206 --> 00:51:26.083
Radio, upstairs. I heard a news bulletin.

00:51:26.166 --> 00:51:28.881
There's a radio upstairs,
and you boarded us in down here?

00:51:28.961 --> 00:51:30.799
- I know what I'm doing.
- What did it say?

00:51:30.879 --> 00:51:33.219
Nothing! Nothing!
They don't know anything yet.

00:51:33.299 --> 00:51:36.096
The... There's mass murder everywhere,

00:51:36.176 --> 00:51:38.891
and people are supposed to look
for a safe place to hide.

00:51:38.971 --> 00:51:41.435
Take the boards off that door.

00:51:41.515 --> 00:51:43.562
We are staying down here, Helen.

00:51:43.642 --> 00:51:46.815
Harry, that radio is at least
some kind of communication.

00:51:46.895 --> 00:51:50.194
If the authorities know what's happening,
well, they'll send people for us,

00:51:50.274 --> 00:51:52.071
or they'll tell us what to do.

00:51:52.151 --> 00:51:56.076
How are we going to know what's going on
if we lock ourselves in this dungeon?

00:52:05.873 --> 00:52:08.171
We may not enjoy living together...

00:52:09.752 --> 00:52:12.841
but dying together
isn't going to solve anything.

00:52:12.921 --> 00:52:14.764
Those people aren't our enemies.

00:52:15.341 --> 00:52:17.093
Mr. Cooper!

00:52:18.427 --> 00:52:21.556
Mr. Cooper?
Ben found a television set upstairs.

00:52:24.183 --> 00:52:26.730
Let's go up. Tom?

00:52:26.810 --> 00:52:28.148
Yes.

00:52:28.228 --> 00:52:31.607
If Judy would come downstairs
for a few minutes,

00:52:31.690 --> 00:52:34.405
Harry and I could come upstairs.

00:52:34.485 --> 00:52:37.079
Okay. Yeah. Right away.

00:52:39.239 --> 00:52:42.162
- Will you do it?
- Do I have to?

00:52:42.242 --> 00:52:46.088
Look, honey, nothing's gonna get done
with them down there and us up here.

00:52:46.830 --> 00:52:49.253
Do this, for me.

00:52:49.333 --> 00:52:50.835
Okay.

00:52:51.502 --> 00:52:53.220
Okay, open up.

00:53:14.983 --> 00:53:17.156
I'll take good care of her, Helen.

00:53:20.030 --> 00:53:21.873
She's all I have.

00:53:23.492 --> 00:53:25.836
Why don't you go upstairs now?

00:53:53.188 --> 00:53:55.277
Her brother was killed.

00:53:55.357 --> 00:53:57.826
Hey, give me a hand with this thing.

00:53:58.652 --> 00:54:01.497
I gotta go help Ben with the television.

00:54:43.947 --> 00:54:46.495
Don't be afraid of me.

00:54:46.575 --> 00:54:49.249
I'm Helen Cooper, Harry's wife.

00:54:57.753 --> 00:54:59.756
This place is ridiculous.

00:54:59.838 --> 00:55:02.933
Look at this.
There's a million weak spots up here.

00:55:05.093 --> 00:55:07.096
Give me one of those.

00:55:11.099 --> 00:55:13.193
Her brother was killed.

00:55:20.359 --> 00:55:23.198
And they talk about these windows.

00:55:23.278 --> 00:55:25.242
I can't see a damned thing.

00:55:25.322 --> 00:55:27.825
There could be 15 million
of those things out there.

00:55:27.908 --> 00:55:30.002
That's how much good these windows are.

00:55:34.081 --> 00:55:36.960
Why don't you do something to help somebody?

00:55:42.214 --> 00:55:44.717
Here, I have it.
Drag a couple of those chairs together.

00:55:44.800 --> 00:55:46.894
There's a socket over here.

00:55:51.473 --> 00:55:54.272
Now, you'd better watch this
and try to understand what's going on.

00:55:56.311 --> 00:55:58.150
I don't want anyone's life on my hands.

00:55:58.230 --> 00:55:59.732
Is there anything I can do to help?

00:55:59.815 --> 00:56:01.692
I don't want to hear
any more from you, mister.

00:56:01.775 --> 00:56:03.947
If you stay up here, you take orders from me!

00:56:04.027 --> 00:56:05.779
And that includes leaving the girl alone.

00:56:05.863 --> 00:56:08.412
- It's on! It's on!
- There's no sound.

00:56:09.491 --> 00:56:11.368
Play with the rabbit ears.

00:56:11.451 --> 00:56:14.416
Reports, incredible as they seem,

00:56:14.496 --> 00:56:16.999
are not the results of mass hysteria.

00:56:17.082 --> 00:56:18.209
Mass hysteria.

00:56:18.292 --> 00:56:20.169
What do they think, we're imagining all this?

00:56:20.252 --> 00:56:21.298
Shut up.

00:56:21.378 --> 00:56:23.130
In all parts of the country.

00:56:23.213 --> 00:56:26.136
The wave of murder which is sweeping
the eastern third of the nation

00:56:26.216 --> 00:56:31.097
is being committed by creatures
who feast upon the flesh of their victims.

00:56:31.805 --> 00:56:34.433
First eyewitness accounts
of this grisly development

00:56:34.516 --> 00:56:39.147
came from people who were understandably
frightened and almost incoherent.

00:56:39.229 --> 00:56:43.735
Officials and newsmen at first discounted
those eyewitness descriptions

00:56:43.817 --> 00:56:45.656
as being beyond belief.

00:56:45.736 --> 00:56:47.950
However, the reports persisted.

00:56:48.030 --> 00:56:50.658
Medical examinations of some of the victims

00:56:50.741 --> 00:56:53.961
bore out the fact
that they had been partially devoured.

00:56:56.204 --> 00:56:59.169
I think we have some late word just arriving,

00:56:59.249 --> 00:57:01.297
and we interrupt to bring this to you.

00:57:02.628 --> 00:57:04.631
This is the latest disclosure in a report

00:57:04.713 --> 00:57:07.432
from National Civil Defense headquarters
in Washington.

00:57:08.508 --> 00:57:11.974
It has been established
that persons who have recently died

00:57:12.054 --> 00:57:15.684
have been returning to life
and committing acts of murder.

00:57:16.767 --> 00:57:19.731
A widespread investigation
of reports from funeral homes,

00:57:19.811 --> 00:57:21.483
morgues, and hospitals

00:57:21.563 --> 00:57:25.529
has concluded that the unburied dead
are coming back to life

00:57:25.609 --> 00:57:27.987
and seeking human victims.

00:57:28.612 --> 00:57:31.410
It's hard for us here to believe
what we're reporting to you,

00:57:31.490 --> 00:57:33.493
but it does seem to be a fact.

00:57:34.618 --> 00:57:36.370
When this emergency first began,

00:57:36.453 --> 00:57:39.793
radio and television
was advising people to stay inside,

00:57:39.873 --> 00:57:42.045
behind locked doors, for safety.

00:57:42.125 --> 00:57:44.423
Well, that situation has now changed.

00:57:44.503 --> 00:57:47.843
We're able to report
a definite course of action for you.

00:57:47.923 --> 00:57:50.387
Civil defense machinery has been organized

00:57:50.467 --> 00:57:54.391
to provide rescue stations
with food, shelter, medical treatment,

00:57:54.471 --> 00:57:57.060
and protection by armed national guardsmen.

00:57:57.140 --> 00:58:00.606
Stay tuned to the broadcasting stations
in your local area

00:58:00.686 --> 00:58:02.689
for this list of rescue stations.

00:58:02.771 --> 00:58:05.775
This list will be repeated
throughout our news coverage.

00:58:05.857 --> 00:58:08.986
Look for the name
of the rescue station nearest you

00:58:09.069 --> 00:58:12.534
and make your way to that location
as soon as possible.

00:58:12.614 --> 00:58:15.368
So we have that truck. If we can get
some gas, we can get outta here.

00:58:15.450 --> 00:58:18.248
- There's a pump out by the shed.
- I know. That's why I pulled in here.

00:58:18.328 --> 00:58:19.875
But it's locked.

00:58:19.955 --> 00:58:22.169
...emergency meeting called
this afternoon by the president.

00:58:22.249 --> 00:58:25.213
Since convening,
this conference of the presidential cabinet,

00:58:25.293 --> 00:58:28.797
the FBI, the joint chiefs of staff, the CIA

00:58:28.880 --> 00:58:31.258
has not produced any public information.

00:58:31.341 --> 00:58:36.063
Why are space experts being consulted
about an earthbound emergency?

00:58:36.930 --> 00:58:39.895
So far, all the betting
on the answer to that question

00:58:39.975 --> 00:58:42.854
centers on the recent explorer satellite
shot to Venus.

00:58:44.146 --> 00:58:48.946
That satellite, you recall,
started back to Earth, but never got here.

00:58:49.026 --> 00:58:50.989
That's the space vehicle which orbited Venus

00:58:51.069 --> 00:58:53.867
and then was purposely destroyed by NASA

00:58:53.947 --> 00:58:55.869
when scientists discovered it was carrying

00:58:55.949 --> 00:58:58.789
a mysterious, high-level radiation with it.

00:58:58.869 --> 00:59:01.541
Could that radiation be somehow responsible

00:59:01.621 --> 00:59:04.461
for the wholesale murders
we're now suffering?

00:59:04.541 --> 00:59:07.881
Newsman Don Quinn in Washington
has posed those questions.

00:59:07.961 --> 00:59:10.634
It's obvious.
Our best move is to try to get out of here.

00:59:10.714 --> 00:59:13.263
- How are you gonna get over to that pump?
- Look!

00:59:14.509 --> 00:59:17.012
You're coming from a meeting regarding
the explosion of the Venus probe.

00:59:17.095 --> 00:59:18.597
Is that right?

00:59:18.680 --> 00:59:20.557
Yes, yes,
that was the subject of the meeting.

00:59:20.640 --> 00:59:23.355
Do you feel there is a connection
between this and the phenomenon...

00:59:23.435 --> 00:59:26.024
There's a definite connection.
A definite connection.

00:59:26.104 --> 00:59:28.402
In other words, you feel that
the radiation on the Venus probe

00:59:28.482 --> 00:59:30.070
is enough to cause these mutations?

00:59:30.150 --> 00:59:32.823
- There was a very high degree of radiation.
- Well, just a minute.

00:59:32.903 --> 00:59:35.701
I'm not sure that that's certain at all.
I don't think that has been...

00:59:35.781 --> 00:59:38.578
It's the only logical explanation
that we have at this time.

00:59:38.658 --> 00:59:40.786
In other words,
it is the military's viewpoint that this...

00:59:40.869 --> 00:59:42.997
the radiation
is not the cause of the mutation.

00:59:43.080 --> 00:59:46.459
I can't speak for the entire military
at this time, gentlemen.

00:59:46.541 --> 00:59:48.794
I must disagree
with these gentlemen presently,

00:59:48.877 --> 00:59:51.800
until we... until this is irrefutably proved.

00:59:51.880 --> 00:59:54.052
Everything is being done that can be done.

00:59:54.132 --> 00:59:56.430
We'll have to hurry for our next meeting.

00:59:57.719 --> 00:59:59.972
Professor, you feel that there is
a definite connection between...

01:00:00.055 --> 01:00:02.894
A definite connection
as far as Dr. Keller and myself...

01:00:02.974 --> 01:00:06.523
Doctor, please. I thought
we decided that is not proved yet.

01:00:06.603 --> 01:00:09.482
Was it... Was the satellite...
When the satellite was exploded...

01:00:09.564 --> 01:00:11.567
It was an unusual amount of radiation,

01:00:11.650 --> 01:00:14.364
enough to cause mutation
under certain circumstances.

01:00:14.444 --> 01:00:16.783
Could have happened to have a bearing on it.

01:00:16.863 --> 01:00:19.077
It does seem to have a bearing on it.

01:00:19.157 --> 01:00:21.911
- Will there be a reply for the...
- Later.

01:00:21.993 --> 01:00:23.415
- Yes.
- There will be a reply?

01:00:23.495 --> 01:00:25.498
- Yes.
- Later this afternoon?

01:00:27.415 --> 01:00:29.337
There will be a report this afternoon?

01:00:29.417 --> 01:00:31.670
- Perhaps there will be a report later.
- Yes. Yes.

01:00:31.753 --> 01:00:33.255
Will you close the window?

01:00:33.338 --> 01:00:36.137
We are doing everything possible
to solve the problem.

01:00:38.635 --> 01:00:42.309
We're hoping to get some
further explanation of this...

01:00:42.389 --> 01:00:44.767
We've heard all we need to know.
We have to try to get out of here.

01:00:44.850 --> 01:00:47.814
He said the rescue stations
have doctors and medical supplies.

01:00:47.894 --> 01:00:50.317
If we could get Karen there,
we can get help for her.

01:00:50.397 --> 01:00:52.611
...is one of the world's foremost authorities

01:00:52.691 --> 01:00:54.694
on space science and technology.

01:00:54.776 --> 01:00:56.990
Willard. I saw a sign that said Willard.

01:00:57.070 --> 01:00:59.367
It's only about 17 miles from here.

01:00:59.447 --> 01:01:01.411
You know this area. Are you from around here?

01:01:01.491 --> 01:01:03.455
Judy and I are both from around here.

01:01:03.535 --> 01:01:05.707
We were on our way up to the lake
to go swimming.

01:01:05.787 --> 01:01:08.835
And Judy had a radio,
and we heard the first reports about this.

01:01:08.915 --> 01:01:10.962
So we knew the old house was here
and we came in

01:01:11.042 --> 01:01:13.256
and found the lady upstairs, dead.

01:01:13.336 --> 01:01:14.963
Then these other people came.

01:01:15.046 --> 01:01:17.344
We went down into the basement
and put a bar across the door,

01:01:17.424 --> 01:01:18.926
and it is pretty strong.

01:01:19.009 --> 01:01:21.387
How could we possibly get away from here?

01:01:21.469 --> 01:01:23.972
We've got a sick child, two women,

01:01:24.055 --> 01:01:25.682
one woman out of her head,

01:01:25.765 --> 01:01:28.814
three men, and the place
is surrounded with these things.

01:01:29.978 --> 01:01:32.818
Dr. Grimes, your entire staff, I know,

01:01:32.898 --> 01:01:34.650
has been working very hard

01:01:34.733 --> 01:01:38.156
to find some solution
to these things that are happening.

01:01:38.236 --> 01:01:40.239
Do you have any answers at this time?

01:01:40.322 --> 01:01:42.160
Yes, we have some answers.

01:01:42.240 --> 01:01:45.914
But first let me stress the importance
of seeking medical attention

01:01:45.994 --> 01:01:48.083
for anyone who's been injured in any way.

01:01:48.163 --> 01:01:52.418
We don't know yet what complications
might result from such injuries.

01:01:52.500 --> 01:01:53.968
How bad has your kid been hurt?

01:01:56.379 --> 01:01:58.632
Um...

01:01:58.715 --> 01:02:01.888
Look, you go down there and tell... Judy?

01:02:01.968 --> 01:02:05.433
Yeah, you tell Judy to come up here,
and you stay with the kid, all right?

01:02:05.513 --> 01:02:08.979
Destructive action taken
with regard to the Venus probe.

01:02:09.059 --> 01:02:11.481
In the cold room at the university,

01:02:11.561 --> 01:02:13.063
we had a cadaver.

01:02:13.146 --> 01:02:17.445
A cadaver from which all four limbs
had been amputated.

01:02:17.525 --> 01:02:19.489
Sometime early this morning,

01:02:19.569 --> 01:02:22.742
it opened its eyes
and began to move its trunk.

01:02:22.822 --> 01:02:26.042
It was dead,
but it opened its eyes and tried to move.

01:02:28.703 --> 01:02:31.832
They want you upstairs. Did she ask for me?

01:02:31.915 --> 01:02:34.379
She hasn't said anything.

01:02:34.459 --> 01:02:36.462
I don't understand.

01:02:37.254 --> 01:02:40.224
Baby? It's Mommy.

01:02:41.424 --> 01:02:42.721
I hurt.

01:02:44.010 --> 01:02:47.514
I'll come back down
as soon as I find out what they want.

01:02:47.597 --> 01:02:49.440
Thank you, Judy.

01:02:50.183 --> 01:02:52.105
The bodies should be disposed of at once,

01:02:52.185 --> 01:02:53.982
preferably by cremation.

01:02:54.062 --> 01:02:55.689
Well, how long after death, then,

01:02:55.772 --> 01:02:57.649
does the body become reactivated?

01:02:57.732 --> 01:02:59.404
It's only a matter of minutes.

01:02:59.484 --> 01:03:02.199
Minutes? Well, that doesn't give people
time to make any arrangements.

01:03:02.279 --> 01:03:05.744
No, you're right. It doesn't give them
time to make funeral arrangements.

01:03:05.824 --> 01:03:10.205
The bodies must be carried
to the street and... and burned.

01:03:10.287 --> 01:03:11.958
They must be burned immediately.

01:03:12.038 --> 01:03:14.502
Soak them with gasoline and burn them.

01:03:14.582 --> 01:03:17.961
The bereaved will have to forgo
the dubious comforts

01:03:18.044 --> 01:03:20.508
that a funeral service will give.

01:03:20.588 --> 01:03:23.832
They're just dead flesh, and dangerous.

01:03:23.925 --> 01:03:28.975
Judy, I need you to find some bedspreads
or sheets to tear up into small strips, okay?

01:03:29.055 --> 01:03:31.058
- Is there a fruit cellar here?
- Yes.

01:03:31.141 --> 01:03:33.644
We need some bottles or jars
to make Molotov cocktails

01:03:33.727 --> 01:03:35.354
to hold them off while we try to escape.

01:03:35.437 --> 01:03:37.484
Hey, there's a big can
of kerosene down there.

01:03:37.564 --> 01:03:40.278
- I'll see what I can find.
- I'll look for the bottles.

01:03:40.358 --> 01:03:42.155
There's a big key ring down there.

01:03:42.235 --> 01:03:44.324
There may be a key to the gas pump on it.

01:03:44.404 --> 01:03:45.992
I'll check.

01:03:46.072 --> 01:03:48.870
We can toss the cocktails
from a window upstairs.

01:03:48.950 --> 01:03:51.248
Meantime, a couple of us
can go out and try to get the gas,

01:03:51.328 --> 01:03:52.916
then come back for the rest of the people.

01:03:52.996 --> 01:03:54.793
But that'll leave a door open someplace.

01:03:54.873 --> 01:03:57.921
Yeah, that's right. It better be this door.

01:03:58.001 --> 01:04:00.129
It's closer to the truck.

01:04:00.211 --> 01:04:02.801
Before we go out, we'll put
some supplies behind the cellar door.

01:04:02.881 --> 01:04:04.970
While we're gone,
the rest of you can hole up in there.

01:04:05.050 --> 01:04:07.138
I found some fruit jars in the cellar.

01:04:07.218 --> 01:04:09.972
And there's a key on here
that's labeled for the gas pump out back.

01:04:11.514 --> 01:04:14.518
I'm not really that used to the truck.
I found it abandoned.

01:04:15.518 --> 01:04:17.862
I can handle the truck, no sweat.

01:04:20.857 --> 01:04:23.406
You're it then. You and I will go.

01:04:28.406 --> 01:04:32.122
We'll put whatever lumber we find
behind the cellar door.

01:04:32.202 --> 01:04:35.667
You can go upstairs
and toss the cocktails from a window.

01:04:35.747 --> 01:04:38.000
Tom, you and I will have
to unboard this door.

01:04:38.083 --> 01:04:40.962
After you toss the cocktails,
you hustle back down here and lock this door.

01:04:41.044 --> 01:04:45.015
It's no good to board it up
because we'll have to get back in quickly.

01:04:45.715 --> 01:04:48.719
After we get the gas
and get back into the house,

01:04:48.802 --> 01:04:51.180
then we'll worry
about getting everybody into the truck.

01:04:51.262 --> 01:04:52.764
Now, let's move it.

01:04:53.807 --> 01:04:55.684
No place to flee for safety,

01:04:55.767 --> 01:04:58.315
except for the rescue stations
which have been set up.

01:04:58.395 --> 01:05:01.735
Indications are
that before this emergency is over,

01:05:01.815 --> 01:05:05.740
we will need many, many more
such rescue stations.

01:05:14.244 --> 01:05:16.497
You always have a smile for me.

01:05:16.579 --> 01:05:19.253
How can you smile like that all the time?

01:05:20.875 --> 01:05:22.878
How many do you have done?

01:05:26.005 --> 01:05:27.803
Come on, honey. We gotta move.

01:05:28.633 --> 01:05:32.057
- Tom, are you sure about the phone?
- The phone is dead out.

01:05:32.137 --> 01:05:34.231
All you get is a recorded message.

01:05:35.306 --> 01:05:38.685
If I could only call the folks.
They're going to be so worried about us.

01:05:40.145 --> 01:05:41.897
Everything'll be all right.

01:05:41.980 --> 01:05:44.904
As soon as we get to Willard, we'll
call them. They might even be there.

01:05:46.192 --> 01:05:47.694
I know.

01:05:51.281 --> 01:05:52.783
- Tom?
- Hmm.

01:05:54.701 --> 01:05:56.790
Are you sure we're doing
the right thing, Tom?

01:05:56.870 --> 01:05:59.042
- What, about getting outta here?
- Yeah.

01:05:59.122 --> 01:06:01.836
Well, the television said
that's the right thing to do.

01:06:01.916 --> 01:06:03.668
We've got to get to a rescue station.

01:06:04.461 --> 01:06:06.299
- I don't know.
- Come on, honey.

01:06:06.379 --> 01:06:08.131
You're starting to sound like Mr. Cooper now.

01:06:08.214 --> 01:06:10.091
But why do you have to go out there?

01:06:10.175 --> 01:06:14.055
Look, I know how to handle that truck.
And I can handle the pump.

01:06:14.137 --> 01:06:16.105
Ben doesn't know anything about that stuff.

01:06:17.974 --> 01:06:20.563
- But we're safe in here.
- For how long, honey?

01:06:20.643 --> 01:06:22.771
We're safe now.

01:06:22.854 --> 01:06:24.943
But there's gonna be more and more
of those things.

01:06:25.023 --> 01:06:27.026
I know. I know all that.

01:06:31.070 --> 01:06:33.410
Hey. Listen.

01:06:33.490 --> 01:06:36.037
Remember when we had the big flood?

01:06:36.117 --> 01:06:39.838
Remember how difficult it was for us
to convince you that it was right to leave?

01:06:40.747 --> 01:06:43.375
Remember?
Remember we had to go to Willard then?

01:06:43.458 --> 01:06:45.836
This isn't a passing thing, honey.

01:06:45.919 --> 01:06:49.634
It... It's not like
just a wind passing through.

01:06:49.714 --> 01:06:52.308
We've got to do something, and fast.

01:06:58.348 --> 01:07:01.020
I just don't want you to go out there,
that's all.

01:07:01.100 --> 01:07:02.772
Hey.

01:07:02.852 --> 01:07:05.024
Smile, honey.

01:07:05.104 --> 01:07:07.107
Where's that big smile for me?

01:07:09.484 --> 01:07:11.361
Boy.

01:07:11.444 --> 01:07:14.033
You sure are no use at all, are you?

01:07:14.113 --> 01:07:16.661
We've got work to do, honey.

01:07:16.741 --> 01:07:18.368
And you... you...

01:07:35.093 --> 01:07:36.890
We better get her downstairs.

01:07:36.970 --> 01:07:39.598
We have to go downstairs now, Barbra.

01:07:41.349 --> 01:07:43.521
She's right. You have to go downstairs now.

01:07:43.601 --> 01:07:46.730
Just for a little while, until we get back.

01:07:46.813 --> 01:07:48.735
Then we can all leave.

01:07:48.815 --> 01:07:51.239
Oh, I'd like to leave. Yes.

01:08:10.545 --> 01:08:12.764
- Good luck.
- Yeah.

01:09:02.472 --> 01:09:04.018
- You ready upstairs?
- Yeah.

01:09:04.098 --> 01:09:05.896
Okay, toss 'em!

01:09:46.099 --> 01:09:47.442
Go ahead! Go on!

01:10:03.658 --> 01:10:05.955
- I'm going with him.
- Get back in the cellar!

01:10:06.035 --> 01:10:08.254
- No!
- It's too late. Too late!

01:10:16.295 --> 01:10:18.593
Well, is she coming? Come on.

01:10:19.924 --> 01:10:21.426
Get in!

01:11:33.706 --> 01:11:35.920
- Come on!
- This key won't work.

01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:37.218
Watch it.

01:11:43.090 --> 01:11:44.217
Watch the torch!

01:11:51.265 --> 01:11:53.017
We've gotta get away from the pump!

01:12:04.570 --> 01:12:05.913
Hang on!

01:12:06.989 --> 01:12:09.663
Tom! Tom, you guys need
to get out of the truck!

01:12:28.261 --> 01:12:30.605
Come on. Let's get outta here.

01:12:31.430 --> 01:12:34.855
- Come on, come on!
- My jacket's caught.

01:13:41.626 --> 01:13:44.050
Let me in! Let me in!

01:13:45.254 --> 01:13:46.342
Cooper!

01:13:46.422 --> 01:13:47.514
Cooper!

01:14:50.611 --> 01:14:53.831
I ought to drag you out there
and feed you to those things!

01:16:23.871 --> 01:16:26.044
Isn't it three o'clock yet?

01:16:30.544 --> 01:16:33.548
There's supposed to be another broadcast
at three o'clock.

01:16:33.631 --> 01:16:35.884
Ten minutes.

01:16:35.966 --> 01:16:39.721
Oh. Only 10 more minutes?

01:16:39.804 --> 01:16:42.683
We don't have very long to wait.

01:16:42.765 --> 01:16:44.563
We can leave.

01:16:45.643 --> 01:16:48.271
Well, we'd better leave soon.

01:16:48.354 --> 01:16:50.448
It's 10 minutes to 3:00.

01:16:55.903 --> 01:16:59.828
You know anything about this area at all?
I mean, is Willard the nearest town?

01:17:02.326 --> 01:17:04.169
I don't know.

01:17:06.247 --> 01:17:07.749
We were...

01:17:10.126 --> 01:17:13.346
just trying to get to a motel before dark.

01:17:14.547 --> 01:17:16.550
You said those things turned your car over.

01:17:16.632 --> 01:17:19.430
You think we can get it back
on its wheels and drive it? Where is it?

01:17:19.510 --> 01:17:22.475
Seems like it was pretty far away.

01:17:22.555 --> 01:17:24.353
Seems like we ran.

01:17:25.349 --> 01:17:27.192
Forget it. It's at least a mile.

01:17:27.935 --> 01:17:29.608
Johnny has the keys.

01:17:30.229 --> 01:17:33.778
You're going to carry that child a mile?
Through that army of things out there?

01:17:33.858 --> 01:17:37.362
I can carry the kid.
What's wrong with her? How'd she get hurt?

01:17:39.029 --> 01:17:41.999
- One of those things grabbed her.
- Bit her on the arm.

01:17:43.993 --> 01:17:45.164
What's wrong?

01:17:45.244 --> 01:17:48.959
Who knows what kind of disease
those things carry?

01:17:49.039 --> 01:17:51.633
- Is she conscious?
- Barely.

01:17:52.293 --> 01:17:53.920
She can't walk. She's too weak.

01:17:57.590 --> 01:18:01.680
- Well, one of us could try to get to the car.
- You gonna turn it over by yourself?

01:18:01.760 --> 01:18:05.014
You can't start the car. Johnny has the keys.

01:18:08.434 --> 01:18:11.563
You have a car? Where? Where is it?

01:18:11.645 --> 01:18:14.023
- You won't be able to start it.
- Yeah. Yeah, I know.

01:18:14.106 --> 01:18:16.200
But where is it?

01:18:28.412 --> 01:18:29.914
Good Lord.

01:18:40.132 --> 01:18:41.884
...being monitored closely by scientists

01:18:41.967 --> 01:18:44.971
at all the radiation detection stations.

01:18:45.054 --> 01:18:48.894
At this hour, they report the level
of the mysterious radiation

01:18:48.974 --> 01:18:50.772
continues to increase steadily.

01:18:51.560 --> 01:18:53.688
So long as this situation remains,

01:18:53.771 --> 01:18:56.735
government spokesmen warn
that dead bodies will continue

01:18:56.815 --> 01:18:59.405
to be transformed
into the flesh-eating ghouls.

01:18:59.485 --> 01:19:04.034
All persons who die during this crisis,
from whatever cause,

01:19:04.114 --> 01:19:06.537
will come back to life to seek human victims

01:19:06.617 --> 01:19:10.457
unless their bodies
are first disposed of by cremation.

01:19:10.537 --> 01:19:13.040
Our news cameras have just returned

01:19:13.123 --> 01:19:16.502
from covering such a search-and-destroy
operation against the ghouls,

01:19:16.585 --> 01:19:19.008
this one conducted
by Sheriff Conan McClelland

01:19:19.088 --> 01:19:21.091
in Butler County, Pennsylvania.

01:19:21.173 --> 01:19:23.637
So now let's go to that filmed report.

01:19:23.717 --> 01:19:26.432
All law enforcement agencies and the military

01:19:26.512 --> 01:19:30.603
have been organized to search out
and destroy the marauding ghouls.

01:19:30.683 --> 01:19:33.772
The survival command center
at the Pentagon has disclosed

01:19:33.852 --> 01:19:38.027
that a ghoul can be killed
by a shot in the head

01:19:38.107 --> 01:19:40.696
or a heavy blow to the skull.

01:19:40.776 --> 01:19:42.653
Officials are quoted as explaining

01:19:42.736 --> 01:19:46.535
that since the brain of a ghoul
has been activated by the radiation,

01:19:46.615 --> 01:19:50.961
the plan is,
kill the brain and you kill the ghoul.

01:19:52.037 --> 01:19:55.336
- Want anything from the supply wagon, Kus?
- Uh, no, we're all right.

01:19:55.416 --> 01:19:56.793
Okay.

01:19:56.875 --> 01:19:59.173
Hey, Cass,
put that thing all the way in the fire.

01:19:59.253 --> 01:20:01.631
- We don't want it getting up again.
- All right. I gotcha.

01:20:01.714 --> 01:20:03.842
Chief McClelland, how is everything going?

01:20:03.924 --> 01:20:07.348
Ah, things aren't going too bad.
Men are taking it pretty good.

01:20:07.428 --> 01:20:10.017
You want to get on the other side
of the road over there.

01:20:10.097 --> 01:20:12.519
Chief, do you think we'll be able
to defeat these things?

01:20:12.599 --> 01:20:15.189
Well, we killed 19 of them today,
right in this area.

01:20:15.269 --> 01:20:18.523
Those last three we caught trying to
claw their way into an abandoned shed.

01:20:18.605 --> 01:20:20.608
They must have thought somebody was in there.

01:20:20.691 --> 01:20:23.069
There wasn't though.
We heard 'em making all kind of noise.

01:20:23.152 --> 01:20:25.616
We came over and beat 'em off,
blasted 'em down.

01:20:25.696 --> 01:20:27.868
Chief, as soon as you're finished,
can I see you here?

01:20:27.948 --> 01:20:29.161
Yeah, okay.

01:20:29.241 --> 01:20:31.744
Chief, if I were surrounded
by six or eight of these things,

01:20:31.827 --> 01:20:33.454
would I stand a chance with them?

01:20:33.537 --> 01:20:35.834
Well, there's no problem.
If you had a gun, shoot 'em in the head.

01:20:35.914 --> 01:20:37.416
That's a sure way to kill 'em.

01:20:37.499 --> 01:20:40.127
If you don't, get yourself a club or a torch.
Beat 'em or burn 'em.

01:20:40.210 --> 01:20:41.712
They go up pretty easy.

01:20:41.795 --> 01:20:44.298
Well, Chief McClelland,
how long do you think it will take you

01:20:44.381 --> 01:20:46.384
until you get the situation under control?

01:20:46.467 --> 01:20:49.265
Well, that's pretty hard to say.
We don't know how many of 'em there are.

01:20:49.345 --> 01:20:51.973
We know when we find 'em, we can kill 'em.

01:20:52.056 --> 01:20:54.979
- Are they slow-moving, Chief?
- Yeah, they're dead.

01:20:55.059 --> 01:20:56.897
They're all messed up.

01:20:56.977 --> 01:21:01.318
Well, in time, would you say you oughta
be able to wrap this up in 24 hours?

01:21:01.398 --> 01:21:04.026
Well, we don't really know.

01:21:04.109 --> 01:21:07.613
We know we'll be into it most of the night,
probably into the early morning.

01:21:07.696 --> 01:21:09.323
We're working our way toward Willard,

01:21:09.406 --> 01:21:11.534
and we'll team up
with the National Guard over there,

01:21:11.617 --> 01:21:13.620
and then we'll be able
to give a more definite view.

01:21:13.702 --> 01:21:15.329
Thank you very much, Chief McClelland.

01:21:15.412 --> 01:21:19.292
This is Bill Cardille, WIC TV 11 news.

01:21:19.375 --> 01:21:21.252
Thank you, Bill, for that report.

01:21:21.377 --> 01:21:24.925
Official spokesmen declined to speculate
just how long it may take

01:21:25.005 --> 01:21:28.509
to kill off all the flesh eaters
so long as the heavy ra...

01:21:35.182 --> 01:21:38.527
- Is the fuse box in the cellar?
- I don't know. I...

01:21:42.022 --> 01:21:44.275
I... It isn't the fuse.

01:21:45.158 --> 01:21:47.407
The power lines are down.

01:21:49.405 --> 01:21:52.250
Helen, I have to get that gun.

01:21:54.201 --> 01:21:56.290
Haven't you had enough?

01:21:56.370 --> 01:21:59.918
Well, two people are dead already
on account of that guy.

01:21:59.998 --> 01:22:02.001
Take a look out that window. Look at...

01:23:00.058 --> 01:23:01.685
Get over here, man!

01:23:03.395 --> 01:23:04.897
Come on!

01:23:22.122 --> 01:23:24.294
Go ahead. Go ahead.

01:23:24.374 --> 01:23:26.547
You wanna stay up here now?

01:23:26.627 --> 01:23:28.425
Helen, get in the cellar.

01:23:30.756 --> 01:23:32.383
Get in the cellar now. Move!

01:25:09.187 --> 01:25:12.111
No! No!

01:25:16.653 --> 01:25:18.405
Karen?

01:25:18.488 --> 01:25:19.489
Karen?

01:25:23.076 --> 01:25:24.077
Karen.

01:25:27.414 --> 01:25:29.041
Poor baby.

01:25:30.917 --> 01:25:32.099
Baby.

01:26:19.091 --> 01:26:20.968
No! No!

01:26:22.594 --> 01:26:25.848
No! No! No!

01:26:27.432 --> 01:26:28.934
No!

01:26:30.268 --> 01:26:31.815
No! Get out!

01:26:33.980 --> 01:26:36.734
No! No, Johnny!

01:26:36.817 --> 01:26:39.070
No!

01:26:39.152 --> 01:26:41.280
No, no!

01:26:41.363 --> 01:26:43.785
Oh, help me, help me.

01:26:43.865 --> 01:26:45.367
Oh!

01:31:18.014 --> 01:31:22.063
Hey, Vince, Al, you wanna get about
four or five men and a couple dogs?

01:31:22.143 --> 01:31:24.146
There's a house over here behind those trees.

01:31:24.229 --> 01:31:26.983
We wanna go check it out.
You still here, Bill?

01:31:27.065 --> 01:31:30.069
Yeah, Chief, we're going to stay with it
till we meet up with the National Guard.

01:31:30.151 --> 01:31:32.028
- Where'd you get the coffee?
- One of the volunteers.

01:31:32.112 --> 01:31:34.159
- You're doing all the work. You take it.
- Thank you.

01:31:34.239 --> 01:31:36.661
We should be wrapped up here
about three or four more hours.

01:31:36.741 --> 01:31:38.368
We'll probably get into Willard then.

01:31:38.451 --> 01:31:40.874
I guess you can go over there
and meet the National Guard.

01:31:40.954 --> 01:31:43.293
Nick, you and the rest of these men
wanna come with me?

01:31:43.373 --> 01:31:45.545
Bill, I'm gonna check the office,
see what's happening.

01:31:45.625 --> 01:31:48.048
All right, Steve.
Tell 'em we're going to stay with it

01:31:48.128 --> 01:31:51.301
and everything appears to be under control.

01:32:41.181 --> 01:32:43.478
They need you down there by the barn.

01:32:43.558 --> 01:32:45.060
Okay.

01:32:46.770 --> 01:32:49.398
Some of you guys can follow the wagon down.

01:32:49.481 --> 01:32:52.326
I only need a few men to check out the house.

01:32:54.986 --> 01:32:58.835
- Somebody had a cookout here, Vince.
- Yeah, sure looks like it, Con.

01:33:37.403 --> 01:33:39.406
He's a dead one. Get up here!

01:33:40.657 --> 01:33:42.660
Nick! Tony! Steve!

01:33:42.742 --> 01:33:45.166
You wanna get out in that field
and build me a bonfire.

01:33:57.465 --> 01:34:00.594
You, drag that out of here
and throw it on the fire.

01:34:00.677 --> 01:34:02.223
- Nothing down here.
- All right.

01:34:02.303 --> 01:34:04.931
Go ahead down and give 'em a hand.
Let's go check out the house.

01:34:05.014 --> 01:34:07.017
There's something there. I heard a noise.

01:34:11.688 --> 01:34:14.362
All right, Vince. Hit him in the head,
right between the eyes.

01:34:18.153 --> 01:34:21.242
Good shot. Okay, he's dead. Let's go get him.

01:34:21.322 --> 01:34:23.497
That's another one for the fire.

01:34:44.387 --> 01:34:48.728
All right, send a wagon
through directly. Over.

01:34:54.362 --> 01:34:57.067
Keep those dogs back off of those things.

01:35:58.711 --> 01:36:01.384
Come ahead with the motorcycle, please.

01:36:01.464 --> 01:36:02.966
Let's go!

01:36:03.049 --> 01:36:05.097
That's the way!

01:36:06.386 --> 01:36:08.600
Hey, Randy, light these torches over here.

01:36:08.680 --> 01:36:10.557
Get those people in the back.
Way in the back.
